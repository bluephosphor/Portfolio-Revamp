Ever wanted to know what Asteroids recently made a swing by Earth? Well, I created a tool to visualize that as a personal project!

First we fetch today's asteroid data from one of NASA's many amazing [Open APIs]( https://api.nasa.gov/), we're then able to create a fun and interactive demo representing very real data. We're using the JS fetch API to grab the data, and the p5.js library for drawing in the canvas. 

This was a great exercise in Data Visualization and API consumption.
