Client project for [Great Oaks Tavern](https://www.greatoakstavern.com/). A Boardgame cafe located in Wadsworth, Ohio. I created this tool in close collaboration with the team at Great Oaks to help match every party of customers to the perfect board game for their night out!

GOT Games? is a Full-Stack Boardgame suggestion engine powered by Google Firebase in the backend and Vue.js in the frontend. Pulling from BoardGameGeek's XML API, I can then expand upon that data in my own database and then query that database in more complex ways. Currently the app can suggest games in the catalog to customers based on things like playercount, age range, and playtime.

Future features will include things like better sorting, and data collection on game usage and popularity.
